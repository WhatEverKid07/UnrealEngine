# Unreal Engine, my first look at UE

A small solo created first person shooter in Unreal Engine, my first try at using UE and programming with Blueprints.
## How To Play

Just Download the latest release and run FirstGame.exe. Note: Windows only.  
IMPORTANT: There is no start menu, when you want to close the game use Alt+F4.
## Run in Unreal Engine

Click on the blue "<>Code" dropdown and click "download zip".
Unzip the folder and open the "FirstGame.uproject" file in UE.
